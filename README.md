The Great Cookie Hunt is an Android and iOS location-service based (with fully governed location permissions), interactive map game in which you collect cookies and golden tickets to redeem at participating local cookie shops. 

Inspired by a local job posting to develop digital strategy for a certain cookie shop (that did not pan out), this prototype is fully functional to collect cookies, but just for fun (sorry, no free cookies yet). Feedback, suggestions, and business model interests are welcome!

TODOs:

* Implement algorithm that balances loyalty and monetization with cookie exploration
* Better user database w/o PI for tracking cookie and ticket collection and redemption
* Administrative and partner functionalities to manage promotional cookie finds
* Real POS/e-commerce integrations ... if it's worth it someday
