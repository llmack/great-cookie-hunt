The Great Cookie Hunt is an Android and iOS location-service based (with location permissions), interactive map game in which you collect cookies and golden tickets to redeem at participating local cookie shops. 

Inspired by a local job opening, this prototype is fully functional but just for fun. Feedback and suggestions are welcome!

TODOs:
* Improve cookie and ticket placement to refresh as you move around the map
* Implement algorithm that balances loyalty and monetization with cookie exploration
* Better user database w/o PI for tracking cookie and ticket collection and redemption
* Administrative and partner functionalities to manage promotional cookie finds
* Real POS/e-commerce integrations ... if it's worth it someday
